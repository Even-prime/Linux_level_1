Temporary User Setup with Expiry


As part of the temporary assignment to the Nautilus project, a developer named john requires access for a limited duration. To ensure smooth access management, a temporary user account with an expiry date is needed. Here's what you need to do:



Create a user named john on App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter. Set the expiry date to 2027-01-28, ensuring the user is created in lowercase as per standard protocol.



soln : 
 adduser -e 2027-01-28 john
